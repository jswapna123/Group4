        <h2>HOME TRANSFORMATIONS</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the vision of your perfect home goes beyond just
            remodeling one or two spaces. You may feel like it needs a total
            transformation. A home “transformation” can uncover your home’s
            true potential by reshaping every part of your living experience as
             well as refreshing your home’s energy efficiency and mechanical 
                                  structure. </p>

            <p>After setting a comfortable budget, our clients weighed the different buying options in their ideal area in order to achieve the perfect living space. They ultimately purchased a property with an existing house knowing it could be transformed into exactly what they envisioned for their home.

                This project presented some design challenges, as the team worked to fit the footprint of the home within the constraints of two high-pressure gas line easements. Inch by inch, foot by foot, we worked together with the clients for six months in the planning stages to give them the living space they dreamed of.
                
                With the client’s great vision and style, we were able to achieve a beautiful space for them to grow and raise their family. </p>

            <p>"I highly recommend BH Design & Build. They have great communication,<br> both their in-house contractors and subcontractors did fantastic work.<br> Chris, our project manager, Mark, who worked with us on selections, and <br>everyone else was very patient with us and my particular (and sometimes<br> very unique!) requests. The team was always quick to respond to questions<br> and concerns. They were also very flexible with allowing us to use vendors<br>  and even a few sub contractors that we chose, and BH worked<br> extremely well with them.” </p>

          <p>When a couple with a growing family (think: Baby on the way!) came to us with dreams of adding more space to their home, we jumped at the chance to deliver a design that would allow them to stay in a location they loved. With a sharp eye for design, our client was able to communicate exactly what they envisioned, with lots of unique touches throughout the home. A total kitchen renovation, new office and mudroom spaces, and an addition to the back of the house added the extra living space they needed to spread out, entertain more, and feel comfortable in a home they also worked out of part-time.</p>

    <p>“We had a great experience working with the entire team at BH Design + Build. I was very familiar with their work and knew they would do a great job. They didn’t disappoint and brought our vision to life. The design center is awesome. Being able to go there and work with an interior designer was a lot of fun and really helped us bring our ideas to life.”</p>
